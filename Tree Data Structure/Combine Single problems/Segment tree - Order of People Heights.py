# Given heights and infronts array of integers
# Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
# Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the 
# number of persons who are taller than P and standing in front of P

# You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height
# Example:   Heights = [5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4] and InFronts = [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2]
# Output, actual order of heights is =  [5, 3, 2, 1, 6, 4]
